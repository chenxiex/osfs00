Operating System From Scratch
=============================
This fork aims to use qemu on a modern x64 system instead of bochs.

This is not one project.
This is a project series.
Following these steps, you'll see how to write your own Operating System from scratch:

+ `Step 01: A smallest "OS"`_

+ `Step 02: Setup the development environment`_

+ `Step 03: x86 Protect Mode`_

+ `Step 04: Boot loader`_

+ `Step 05: Kernel`_

+ `Step 06: Process`_

+ `Step 07: TTYs`_

+ `Step 08: IPC`_

+ `Step 09: File System`_

+ `Step 10: Memory Management`_

+ `Step 11: Learn with fun`_

There are many ways to learn OS, but I believe the best way is to learn by practice.
There are many open source OS code, but the code bases are huge.
You will get lost in the source code labyrinth.

There are good books, *Operating System: Design and Implementation* by A.S. Tanenbaum and A.S. Woodhull for example,
but they don't teach you where to begin either.
   
That's why you should come here.
If Tanenbaum's book is a reference, my project series is a tutorial.
Prof. Tanenbaum tells you what. I'll tell you how.
